# Shell, init files, variables and expansions


The files listed down bellow are scripts done during **Software Engineering** course with **ALX Africa**. 
`
They aim to learn about initialization files, local, global, and reserved variables, and special parameters in the Shell, and the use of the commands `printenv`, `set`, `export` and `alias` .Also, to practice mathematical operations such as division, subtraction, expansions, and addition, applied to environment variables known as global variables and utilizing aliases.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash
* Tested on 20.04 LTS

## Files

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [0-alias](./0-alias) | Create an alias. |
| [1-hello_you](./1-hello_you) |  Print the message `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user. |
| [2-path](./2-path) | Add `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program. |
| [3-paths](./3-paths) | Count the number of directories in the `PATH`. |
| [4-global_variables](./4-global_variables) | List environment variables. |
| [5-local_variables](./5-local_variables) | List all local variables and environment variables, and functions. |
| [6-create_local_variable](./6-create_local_variable) | Create a new local variable. |
| [7-create_global_variable](./7-create_global_variable) | Create a new global variable. |
| [8-true_knowledge](./8-true_knowledge) | Print the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`. |
| [9-divide_and_rule](./9-divide_and_rule) | Print the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, `POWER` and `DIVIDE` are environment variables. |
| [10-love_exponent_breath](./10-love_exponent_breath) | Display the result of `BREATH` to the power `LOVE` , `BREATH` and `LOVE` are environment variables. |
| [11-binary_to_decimal](./11-binary_to_decimal) | Convert a number from base 2 to base 10.The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable `BINARY`. |
| [12-combinations](./12-combinations) | Print all possible combinations of two letters, except `oo`. Letters are lower cases, from `a` to `z`, one combination per line, the output should be alpha ordered, starting with `aa` and the file should contain maximum 64 characters. |
| [13-print_float](./13-print_float) | Print a number with two decimal places. The number will be stored in the environment variable `NUM`. |
| [100-decimal_to_hexadecimal](./100-decimal_to_hexadecimal) | Convert a number from base 10 to base 16. The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL`. |
| [101-rot13](./101-rot13) |  Encode and decode text using the rot13 encryption. |
| [102-odd](./102-odd) | Print every other line from the input, starting with the first line. |
| [103-water_and_stir](./103-water_and_stir) | Add the two numbers stored in the environment variables `WATER` and `STIR` and print the result. `WATER` is in base `water`:(`01234`) , `STIR` is in base `stir.`:(`01234`) and the result should be in base `bestchol`:(`01234567`). |
