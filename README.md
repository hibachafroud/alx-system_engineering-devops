# System Engineering and DevOps 

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps during Software engineering course with ALX Africa. 
In these projects, I worked with Bash and  practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. 
The specific list of projects are as follows:

* [Shell, basics](./0x00-shell_basics)

* [Shell, permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)

* [Shell, I/O Redirections and filters ](./0x02-shell_redirections)

* [Shell, init files, variables and expansions](./0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
