# Shell, basics


The files listed down bellow are scripts done during **Software Engineering** course with **ALX Africa**. 

They aim to learn how to navigate directories using `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls` ; how to inspect using `ls`, `less` and `file`; how to manipulate files with `cp`, `mv`, `rm` and `mkdir`.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash
* Tested on 20.04 LTS
